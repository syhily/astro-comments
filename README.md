# Astro Headless Comments

A headless comments solution for Astro by using LibSQL.
Given this plugin is based on the `@astrojs/db` a runnable LibSQL instance is required to be used in production.

**This project is still under heavy development to get the first release.**

## Todo List

- [ ] Support database migration on astro db.
- [ ] Support the JWT auth.
